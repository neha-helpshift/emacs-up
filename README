Hi,

This folder contains my Emacs configuration files. To use them, simply rename the parent folder to .emacs.d and put it in your HOME directory.

Folder Structure:
a) customizations.el - Contains tweaks I use to make emacs 'my' environment.
b) key-bindings.el - Contains my personal hot-key choices
c) mode-configs.el - Contains extra configuration for the various emacs-modes I use
d) utility-functions.el - Some functions in emacs-lisp to make life easier

Other Notes:

* I use Caps-Lock key as a third Ctrl key, because I find working easier and faster this way. If you wish to do the same, here is how you can do it:
  a) For Linux:
		Rename the caps-as-ctrl.xmodmap file to .xmodmap and put it in your HOME directory. Then, add the following line to ~/.bash_profile (create this file if you dont have it already):
     xmodmap ~/.xmodmap
Now restart X.

  b) For Windows:
		Double-click on the caps-as-ctrl.reg file. Reboot.

* Please remember that this is my personal .emacs.d, some things may not work 'as is' for you (eg: in some places - especially org-mode - paths are hard-coded according to my preferences)

Thanks, and have fun with emacs,
Vedang
